## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Distinguish between "unread" and "read" notifications
- Select "Mark all as read" to toggle the visual state of the unread notifications and set the number of unread messages to zero
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I used the `:after` pseudo class to add the red circle which distinguishes the read notifications from the unread ones. At first, I was worried that it would be difficult to change this and I considered using a `<div>` instead. But with further research, I found that all I needed to do was to change the class of the required element and the `:after` pseudo class would not apply to it anymore.

### Continued development

I plan on adding a dark theme to this project in the near future!
